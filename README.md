# audiologist-api

TODO
1. H2 database run externally
2. Swagger documentation tags
3. Dockerise



- This API uses H2 database backed by a file storage for simplicity
- The API uses Swagger documentation. 
- Swagger UI provides an UI to view the endpoints and also one can test the endpoints directly from - this UI
- Only unit test cases are provided and these can be extended to write the integration test cases
- Logging for microservices can be done using Sleuth API which can be integrated with Zipkin, but not used in this application
